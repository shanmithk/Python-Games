    "![Vector Example](images/vector_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can move the green line around the player with the left and right arrow\n",
    "keys. The up and down arrow keys will make the line longer or shorter. When you\n",
    "hit the space bar, the player will move along the green line to the new\n",

    "1. Open `04_gravity_bounce_vec.py` \n",
    "2. Add drag to the program, like we did in lesson 01, but use a\n",
    "   vector to represent the drag. Subtract the drag vector from the player's\n",
    "   velocity each time step to make the player slow down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your drag can be configured with a scalar value ( a float ) that is turned into\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember that drag works a lot like thrust: it is a vector that you subtract \n",
    "from the player's velocity. The drag vector should point in the opposite direction\n",

    "velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a more sophisticated, realistic drag, you can make the drag vector\n",
    "proportional to the square of the player's velocity. This is a simple model of\n",
    "air resistance, which is proportional to the square of the velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "* The easiest drag vector is just the negative of the player's velocity, divided\n",
    "  by a scalar value. The negative will make it point in the opposite direction\n",
    "  of the player's velocity, and the scalar value will determine how strong the\n",
    "  drag is. So you might use something like `drag = -velocity * 0.1` to make the\n",
    "  drag 10% of the player's velocity.\n"

    "Now we are going to add thrust to the player. The player will have a thrust\n",
    "vector that will be added to the player's velocity when the player presses the\n",
    "space bar. This will work just like the drag vector, except you will add the\n",
    "thrust vector instead of subtract it, and you will add the thrust vector only\n",
    "when the player jumps, rather than subtracting a little bit every time step. \n",
    "\n",

    "1. Add a thrust vector to the player class. For now, just make the the thrust\n",
    "   vector point up. \n",
    "2. Remove the logic that causes continuous jumping. After the player touches the\n",
    "   ground, the player should stop and not bounce. \n",
    "3. Add a method to the Player, `update_input(self)` that will read the keys.\n",
    "   Call this method along with the other update functions in `update()` If the\n",
    "   player presses the space bar, add the thrust vector to the player's velocity.\n",

    "   screen to show the player which way they are jumping, just like in the\n",
    "   `03_vectors.py` example.\n",
    "3. Update your `update_input()` method to read the arrow keys and adjust the\n",
    "   thrust vector. You can use the left and right arrow keys to change the\n",
