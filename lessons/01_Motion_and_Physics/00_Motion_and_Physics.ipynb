    "# Motion and Physics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the games we will be writing have some physics, which is the motion of\n",
    "objects in the game that should look realistic, like jumping or falling. Pygame\n",
    "has some built in physics functions, but we will also need to write our own\n",
    "physics code. The most basic physics are for moving objects around the screen,\n",
    "so we will start there. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple program that moves a square around the screen, just to\n",
    "see how it works. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the program `01-move.py` \n",
    "2. Run the program and see what it does. Use the arrow keys to move the square\n",
    "   around the screen.\n",
    "3. Read the code and try to understand how it works.\n",
    "4. Read the Pygame documentation for\n",
    "   [pygame.draw](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html) and change the\n",
    "   program to draw a circle for the player instead of a square.\n",
    "5. Read the documentation for\n",
    "   [pygame.key](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html) and change the program\n",
    "   to move the circle with the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Position, Velocity and Acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "Position is where a object is on the screen, and velocity is how fast it is\n",
    "moving, also known as \"speed\". Because we are writing 2D games, our position and\n",
    "speeds will have x and y components. That is, all of the motion of an object on\n",
    "the screen can be described by its motion left and right, the x direction, and\n",
    "up and down, the y direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceleration is a change in velocity, which is a change in speed or direction.\n",
    "You accelerate when you go faster or slower. It doesn't look right if an object\n",
    "just stops moving or starts moving full speed from a stop; to make it look\n",
    "realistic, it has to speed up or slow down a bit at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, this is really easy to do. Suppose we want to move our car to the right, \n",
    "which is the positive x direction. We can write a function that adds a little bit to the\n",
    "x position each time it is called, and the car will move to the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with no acceleration. This car just immedimmediately  starts moving at full speed, \n",
    "10 pixels each time step. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    car.x += 10\n",
    "    \n",
    "    car.draw()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's add some aceleration. We will add a little bit to the speed each time step. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "acceleration = .1\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    car.v += acceleration # Increase the speed by a little bit each time step\n",
    "    car.x += velocity # Move the car by the speed each step\n",
    "    \n",
    "    car.draw()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! We have a car that starts moving slowly and speeds up.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "For assignment 2, read and then run `02_no_acceleration.py` in the\n",
    "lessons directory, then `03_acceleration.py`. Notice that in the\n",
    "program with acceleration, it seems like the red square is linked to the center\n",
    "of the screen with a spring. Read the comments to understand how the programs\n",
    "work and notice the difference in the motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common game mechanic with acelleration is jumping. Let's look at\n",
    "what it takes to make a player jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open `04_gravity.py` \n",
    "2. Review your previous `01_move.py` program to study how keystrokes work in\n",
    "   Pygame.\n",
    "3. Change the `04_gravity.py` program so that instead of always jumping, the\n",
    "   player jumps when the `space` key is pressed.\n",
    "4. Change the program so that the player can jump higher by using the Control\n",
    "   key along with the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus: \n",
    "* Ensure that the player can't jump while in the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: \n",
    "* You might need to read the Pygame documentation for the\n",
    "  [pygame.key](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html) module to see how to\n",
    "  read the keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motion in Two Dimensions and Collisions\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to allow our player to move left and right, we'd quickly have to\n",
    "solve the problem of what happens when the player runs into a wall. This is a\n",
    "collision, and it is a very important part of game. One simple way to handle a\n",
    "collision is to just not let the player move into the wall, but a more realistic\n",
    "way is to bounce the player off the wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collisions with the edges of the screen are simple to detect: the player's position in x or y either\n",
    "exceeds the screen size or goes below zero. Making the player bounce is also easy: just reverse the\n",
    "velocity in the direction of the collision. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if player.x < 0 or player.x > screen_width:\n",
    "    player.v.x = -player.v.x\n",
    "\n",
    "if player.y < 0 or player.y > screen_height:\n",
    "    player.v.y = -player.v.y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copy `05_gravity_bounce.py` into this directory.\n",
    "2. Change the program so that the player doesn't always jump. Instead, the player\n",
    "   jumps only when the `space` key is pressed.\n",
    "3. Change the program so that the player can jump to the left or right by pressing\n",
    "   the `A` or `D` keys. You can pick any angle for the jump. \n",
    "4. Change the program so the player's velocity is reduced by a little bit each\n",
    "   time step. ( aerodynamic wind drag ) When the player's x or y velocity is\n",
    "   less than 0.1, set it to zero. This will make the player slow down and stop.\n",
    "   If the Players velocity is zero, the player can jump again. The player\n",
    "   shoud bounce off the ground.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Jumping up will involve setting the y velocity, and jumping left or right\n",
    "will also involve setting the x velocity.\n",
    "* You can implement drag either by subtracting off a little bit of the velocity,\n",
    "  but you will need to make sure the velocity doesn't go negative. Another way\n",
    "   to do this is to multiply the velocity by a number less than 1, like 0.99.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "First, check in your code! You should check in ( commit ) and push your code\n",
    "regularly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, don't forget about the [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs/index.html). Your programs will\n",
    "get better the more you know about Pygame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open [lessons/02_Classes_and_Objects/README.md](../02_Classes_and_Objects/README.md) to start the next lesson. "
